            <p>And the worst of it all, I still believe in you
              And these nightmares we've kept
              In the heat of it all, I made an enemy
              Put our demons to rest
              So I'll swallow my pride and fall in line
              And you can just say that "everything's fine"
              But we both know that's not enough (mhm)
              So I'll promise you I'll be the best thing for us
              Then I'll fight with your friends, and I'll trash your apartment
              I'll lie to you screaming, "I'd die for you"
              Knowing how hard it'll be to get back where we started
              In Paris, you asked me if I was afraid that we'd fall out of love
              Would that be okay, Emily?</p>
